Historically
CSS resets have been around for a long time. The first reset CSS file was created by Eric Meyer in 2007.
It was a simple file that removed all default browser styling. Since then, many developers have created their own variations of reset CSS files.
 The most popular of these is normalize.css, created by Nicolas Gallagher in 2011. 
Normalize.css is a modern alternative to CSS resets that preserves useful default styles rather than just removing them.
